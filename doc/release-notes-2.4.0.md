phpecc 2.4.0

## New: Schnorr Signatures

An implementation of Schnorr signatures was included in v2.4.0, ported over from 
[the public-square fork of phpecc](https://github.com/paragonie/phpecc/issues/28) and hardened by
Paragon Initiative Enterprises to avoid side-channel leaks.

This Schnorr signature conforms to BIP0340 and uses test vectors provided by the BIP project.
